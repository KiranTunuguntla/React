npm vs npx

npm- node package manager.
	This will connect to npm site to install the dependencies and execute globally/locally.
	
npx- node package execute
	This will connect to npm site and will not install the dependencies, but will execute the directly.
--------------------
WebPack - is introduced to minimise the file size which browser loads by default.
			This will create a file bundle.js which helps in minimizing the size browser loads,

------------------------

babel is a complier/translator to convert JSX to JS.

node_modules folder contains the required libraries.

when will babel convert JSX to JS and where will it store?

Public-index.html

execution flow of files in NPM Start.
npm start-->index.html-->index.js-->index.css

APP files are defaultly created and rendered by local host.
Common styles can be written in index.html
reportWebVitals.js is used to track performance of web page in production.
setupTest.js -- testing FW importing file.
gitignore is used to integrate with GIT
package.json-- details of versions.
package-lock.json -more information/detailed above libraries

src folder-- code is executed in this folder.
by default APP component is created when ever project is created in Node.

ctrl + ~ ---> to open terminal in VS Code.
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned to launch from the Power shell,

Component: is a class/function

	1.Functional Component - latest version we use this. This is stateless component. 
		(props, can hold the data to make it statefull). Props are immuttable(cant be changed)
		before 16.x there is no concept of state in function. After that state is possible.
		ex: Function Name(){}
	2.Class component - This is statefull component.Muttable (values can be changed)
		ex:import { Component } from "react";
			class ComponentClass extends Component
			{
				render(){
					return(
					<div>
						<h1>-----------------------------------------------------------</h1>
						<h1>This is the example of class component. Render should be used here.</h1>
					</div>
					)
				}
			}
			export default ComponentClass;
			
Constructor will be loaded defaultly with component in browser.
-------------------------------------------------------
React Version 18.x Current version.
	Virtual DOM, This is library, where as Angular is Framework

	in Virtual DOM, it will check with previous DOM object and pushes the changed object only to DOM.
	One Way data binding (model to View data copying)
	JSX: java script XML
	Component: Each and every building block is  a component in react.


There should be only one root tag in JS file. <div>************************

export default app; is used to make it used by others
	
	
--------------------------------------
Arrow Function: This is introduced in ES6 features, this reduces the number of lines.

	Normal Function: 
		function addoftwo(a,b)
		{
		let result=a+b;
		return result;
		}
		
	Anonymous Function:
		var add=function(a,b){	
	return a+b;
	}
	
	Arrow Function:
	var add=(a,b)=>a+b  
	var add=(a,b)=>{return a+b} //curly braces are required for return.
	var m1=()=alert("no paramters") // when no parameter function.
	
------------------------
ES7 install in VSCode. This will help in creating template by default using 
rcc- react class component
rce-react class component with export
rfc-react function component
rfce-react function component with export
rafce-react arrow function component with export
rafc-react arrow function component
rfcp-react function component props
rconst- class constructor
allignment in VS Code : Ctrl+K and Ctrl+F
comment--> Ctrl+/
--------------------------
Export****default - If there are multiple component inside file,If this is not mentioned, we need to mention in the parent file (APP.JS) which component has to be picked by:
import {ComponentName} from 'path of file.' --> Import only ComponentName from Path of file
import ComponentName1 from 'path of file' -->Imports default declared component name from path of file
----------------------------	
this.state-- set
this.setstate--update

***setState method is Asynchronouse by default.
To make it Synchronous, this.setState({},()=>{console.log("Present",this.state.isPresent)})
            //  This is an anonymous function, which is call back function, to make it synchronous

MVC--->View (react works only for view).

By default port is 3000, to update port,we need to explicitly confifure in package.json.
Update port:

package.json--> inside sripts tag-->start--> "set PORT=3006 && react-scripts start"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Bindig:
1. using Bind declaration with normal method this.methodName=this.methodName.bind(this)
2. Using Arrow method without bind declaration statehandle=()=>{}
3. Using normal method without bind declaration, and calling with arrow function. <button type="button" onClick={()=>this.stateHandle()}>Present</button>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forms:

to take input form end user in react.
2 types of forms: 
	1.Controlled -->Event, control handling will be taken by react. like event and action.(onChange-->setState)
	2.Uncontrolled --->Ref, DOM will control the form. In uncontrolled form, we need to declare this.input=React.createRed(); in constructor.
	
By default onSubmit action, causes data not to retain.
Use event.PreventDefault()or any.PreventDefault()

after new vesrion of react, uncontrolled form is largely used.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Map is used with Arrays to map the data automatically.
arrays.map(callback function)-->where array index is passed dynamically and need not initialized.
	
declaration example for passing multiple values: This is part of ES6 features
	function(a){}
	function(..a){} -->multiple values can be passed while initiating from parent. this is array.
	
	while passing to array.
	var myName=["1","2"]
	var newArr=[...myName,name=["1"]]
	
delete splice function.

------------------------------------------------to install react icons--------------------------------------------------
to install react icons.
The package can be installed via npm:

npm install react-crud-icons --save
You’ll need to install React and PropTypes separately since those dependencies aren't included in the package.

To rebuild the project:

npm install
npm run build
--------------------------------------------------
let x="10"

let y=10

x==y, true
==, checks only the value and not the type.
x===y, false
===, checks both value and type.

----------
Hooks:
Hook is a concept to define state in a functional concept, there are various OOTB methods for this.
	Ex: useState(initial value) - can not be defined inside looping, 
	useEffect: To make the API calls. This function is mounting+ updating phase of life cycle.

Router: To navigate from one page to another. 
		This has to be explicitly installed in npm.
		
		npm install react-router-dom --save
		
	Route:A route is mapping b/w URL and a component.
	Router: Is a top level component that provides routing infrastructure
		enable routing by index.js--> include the browser router tag with App inside <React.StrictMode>.<BrowserRouter><App /></BrowserRouter>
	Nested Routes: used in login pages. tree.
	Link:enables navigation by creating anchor-like elements that maintains the application state.
		
Axios: get, post, put, delete
 npm install axios

--------------------
JSON Server installation:
npm install -g json-server

create list of users json in folder, where this is installed.

json-server --watch Users.json

by default it will be on port 3000.
to update the port, 
json-server --watch data.json --port 8000
 
---------------
Bootstrap:

To install bootstrap in project folder, run the below commands in cmd.
		npm install bootstrap --save
		npm install --save reactstrap react react-dom

include CDN link in index.html.
-----------------------------------
Component Life Cycle Methods:

These methods r invoked only for clas component

Every component goes throught these are 4 phases.
	1.Initialization: In this phase a component is provided with default props and initial states.
		EX: Constructor of a component class.
	2.Mounting: In this phase react component is created and mounted(inserted) in to the DOM.
		There are 2 methods,
		1.componentWillMount()- This is like a pre mounting. invoked once and just before the react component is about to be mounted into the DOM.
		2.componentDidMount()- This is like a post mount, invoked once and just after react component is mounted, something like render function.
		Ex: 1.componentWillMount-- to call APIS or setting up data from event listeners.
			2.componentDidMount-- 
	3.Updating: This is the phase where the state or props of a component is get updated. React component can be updated when sending new props or or when updating the state.
		componentWillReceiveProps()--This method is invoked when a component is receiving props from parent/child.
		shouldComponentUpdate()---This method tells the React that should it re-render component or skip rendering. This method returns a boolean (TRUE or FALSE) value and 
									accordingly the component would be re-rendered or skipped. By default it return TRUE. This is automatically called during setState method.
		componentWillUpdate()--
		componentDidUpdate()---
			EX: This is called after a component has re-rendered due to changes in its state or props. It's a great place to handle  side effects or perform additional actions based on those changes.
	4.Unmounting:In this phase, React component is get unmounted from the DOM. This is the final phase of the Component’s lifeycle. There is only one method is called in this phase
		componentWillUnmount() :- This method is called just before the component is
								unmounted from the DOM. This method can be used to perform any cleanup task such as –
								invalidating timers or cleaning up DOM elements.


*****************In functional component as well, we can use lifecycle methods but with different methods using hooks*******************



State Lifting:
child to parent

Props Drilling:

Redux and context API are state management tools in react. 

Context API:
This is default, inbuilt state management library.
This is given in 16.3 . Which is state management library. 
Used for accessing state by nested/child components instead of props drilling.
State can be defined for both app and component in a container.
	1.Create Context. -->const UserContext=React.CreateContext()
	2.Provide the context. 
	3.Consume the context value.


Redux State Container:

Redux is in market before the Context API was introduced.
To hold the state centrally for all nested components.

Redux is a pattern and library for managing application state, using event called actions.
Redux is a predictable state container library.
Redux is open source JS library.
react-redux is official UI binding library.
react-redux provides a set of APIs/Functions which will help you to connect to react app,

Store: Hold the state of application, which brings actions and reducer together.

Action:Should have 2 properties,what should be changed in state and type of action.

Reducer: Which actually carries out of the state transition. 

Js app--->dispatch function-->Action-->Reducer-->Redux store-->Subscribed by JS App-->JS APP

npm install -g redux --force      //install redux
npm install -g react-redux --force	//install react redux
npm install redux-thunk --save --force //install react thunk
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit --force
npm install --save-dev redux-devtools --force


useSelector hook will fetch the state from react store and once 


these below tags has to be included in APP.js and all the components have to be included inside them.
store passed as props is custom js file.
<Provider store={store}>

</Provider>
-------------------
Redux Thunk: 

By default redux is synchronous.
To make redux async, we need to use thunk. 
Thunk is a middleware library.(redux-thunk)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Performance: Enables cache to avoid unnecessary re-render.
Memorization:Cache

Class component will use PureComponent. 
	Pure Component- This will have input values and the calculation is based only on inputs. This will get rendered only if input prop/state changes for that component.
Functional Component - 
	useCallBack, 
	UseMemo,
	Memo- this will work only for props, but not functional props.


React Hooks:
UseForm()- given by react hook form, custom component. 

useState
useEffect
useContext
useForm

memo- memo will be used only for props and state from parent. If the functional props are used, we need to use memo in combination with useCallBack or useMemo.
useCallBack- return the memoized call function, this will b e used by memo hook.
useMemo- returns memoized value.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Lazy Loading/dynamic import:
All components should not be loaded in the APP component, even if they are commented. As the system tries to compile the logic/load the component.
Lazy Loading is used to declare the import, so that the component will be imported only when reference.
	Ex:const About=React.lazy(()=> import ('./About'));
	To show loading sign,<React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <About></About>
    </React.Suspense>
-----------------------------------------------

next.js

This is react FW, used for routing.
This will support client side rendering.
released in 2015.
current version: 15.x

1.npm i -g create-next-app 
2.npm i -g create-next-app projectname

TYPESCRIPT= java script+type
EsLint -converter this will check the code quality
Tailwind CSS -Yes...

3.npm run build after moving in to project folder.
4.npm run start

5.npm run dev can also be run instead of step 3,4

Get started by editing app/page.tsx



This will help in easy development.
React is not feasible to create fully-featured app ready for prod. 
So next JS will solve it, by providing additional features(routing,optimised rendering,fetching,compiling, bundling), will make prod ready.


how system executes the next js app.
layout.tsx-->children function

We can create page.tsx in different folder and launching host/foldername will automatically load the component page.tsx

This is has file system based routing mechanism.

routing conventions:
	all routes must be placed inside the app folder.
	every file that corresponds to a route must correspond to page.js/tsx
	every folder inside the app folder, corresponds to a path segment as URL.
	If the component has to be having input, create file name in []. ex: [productid]
	 
we can remove warnings in the files, by making strict as false in tsconfig.json (if type is not declared)



React Server Component:
1.Server
	All components are server components by default.they perform task like interacting with DB and files and will not be able to use hooks and handle user interaction.

2.Client
	to make a client component, useClient has to be included. This will not be able to interact with DB and files and hooks can be used.

client-->Server
Server sends index.html and bundle.js(the total code)

due to client side rendering(static Side Generation), bundle.js will be having huge file size and will take time to load.


in Server Side Rendering(SSR): in next JS this is default, and server sends only index.html by running in server and result will only be sent.
loading time will be reduced.
